# Clonable - AI Site Generator

### Instantly generate single-page websites from a simple text prompt using the power of the Google Gemini API.



## About The Project

Clonable is a web application that bridges the gap between idea and prototype. It allows designers, developers, and creators to quickly visualize website concepts by simply describing them in plain English. This tool leverages the advanced capabilities of the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a modern, responsive webpage on the fly.

This project was built to demonstrate the power of LLMs in front-end development and to provide a useful tool for rapid prototyping.
